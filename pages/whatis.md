## What are the symptoms? 什么是图雷特综合征?

TS is characterised by rapid, repetitive and involuntary muscle movements and vocalisations called “tics”, and often involves behavioural difficulties. The term “involuntary”, used to describe tics, is a source of confusion since it is known that most people with TS do have some control over their symptoms. What is often not recognised is that the control which can be exerted, from seconds to hours at a time, only delays more severe outbursts of symptoms.

Tics are experienced as a build up of tension, are irresistible and eventually must be performed. Typically tics increase as a result of tension or stress and decrease with relaxation or concentration on an absorbing task. TS symptoms have long been misconstrued as a sign of behavioural abnormality or “nervous habits”, which they are not.

TS的特点是快速、重复和非自愿的肌肉运动和发声(又称为“tics”,抽动或抽搐)，并常常涉及行为上的困难。用术语“非自愿”来修饰抽搐常导致混乱，因为大多数患者其实可以在一定程度上控制他们的症状。这种压制可以持续几秒钟到几小时，但只是暂时推延了严重症状的爆发。

这种抽动的体验类似于一种焦虑或者紧张的积累，它不可抗拒，最终需要被释放。当环境压力或者紧张程度增加时，患者的抽搐症状增加；而放松的环境或者吸引注意力的活动能减少症状。TS症状长期被误解为行为异常或“焦躁的习惯”的表现，事实并不是这样。

## How are tics classified?抽搐是如何分类的？

The two categories of the tics of TS and some common examples are:
抽搐的类型及常见例子为：

**SIMPLE 简单型**

- Motor – eye blinking, head jerking, shoulder shrugging, facial grimacing, nose twitching 眨眼 扭头 耸肩 扭鼻子 做鬼脸 
- Vocal – throat clearing, barking noises, squealing, grunting, gulping, sniffing, tongue clicking 清嗓子 怪叫 尖叫 吞咽 吸鼻子 咂舌 

**COMPLEX 复合型**

- Motor – jumping, touching other people and things, twirling about, repetitive movements of the torso or limbs, pulling at clothing and self-injurious actions including hitting or biting oneself 蹦跳 触摸别的人或物 转圈 躯干或四肢的重复运动 拽衣服 拍打自己 咬自己
- Vocal – uttering words or phrases, coprolalia (the involuntary utterance of inappropriate or obscene words), echoalia (repeating a sound, word or phrase just heard) or palilalia(repeating one’s own words) 秽语 学话 重复字词 

The variety and complexity of tics or tic-like symptoms that can be seen in TS is enormous. 在TS患者中可见的抽搐或类抽搐症状种类繁多。

## Do people with TS have all of these symptoms or just some of them? TS患者具有以上所有症状还是部分症状？

People with TS rarely have all of these symptoms. Most people will exhibit some or many symptoms over a long period of time and in varying degrees: mild, moderate or severe. In milder cases a person may have just a few tics or twitches, which may be confined to the face, eye and shoulder areas. In more severe cases several areas of the body may be affected.

TS患者极少具有以上全部症状。大部分人在较长时段里表现特定几个症状，其程度在轻微、中等、严重之间波动。对于轻微者来说，可能只有局限于面部、眼部和肩部的几下抽搐或抽动。在更严重的情况下，身体的多个部位受到影响。

The symptoms wax and wane, in some cases from day to day but more commonly over 3 to 4 month periods. The waxing and waning pattern can sometimes be frightening to people with TS who may find it difficult to understand the sudden intensification or waning of symptoms.

症状的程度通常上下起伏，通常以3到4个月为周期，有时也以天为周期。症状的突然加剧或减弱，可能让TS患者感到不安。

## Are there behaviour problems which may occur frequently in addition to tics?除了抽动，有什么经常伴随的行为问题吗?

Yes, but not always. Additional problems may include: 有 但不总是

**Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)**, in which the person feels that something must be done over and over. Examples include touching an object with one hand after touching it with the other to “even things out” and repeatedly checking to see that the flame on the stove is turned out. Children sometimes repeat a sentence or action many times until it is “just right”. OCD can include counting rituals, obsessive preoccupations or thoughts which are unpleasant.

强迫症。在这种情况下，患者觉得有些事情必须反复进行。例如，用一只手触摸一个物体后，另一只也必须触摸以凑成“偶数”；反复检查火炉上的火焰是否已经熄灭；孩子们重复句子或动作很多次，直至“恰到好处”为止。强迫症还包括仪式性的数数、全神贯注或不愉快的想法。

**Attention Deficit &/or Hyperactivity Disorder (ADD/ADHD)** may include difficulty in concentrating, being easily distracted, failing to finish tasks, acting on impulse, not seeming to listen, shifting constantly from one activity to another, needing a great deal of supervision, being unable to sit still, calling out and lack of self-control. Adults may have residual signs of ADD such as overly impulsive behaviour and concentration difficulties. Learning Difficulties such as dyslexia, arithmetic and perceptual difficulties, handwriting problems.

注意力缺陷-多动。主要包括注意力障碍，易于分析，无法完成任务，举止冲动，倾听时走神，不断切换手头事务，需要大量监督，坐不住，叫不应，缺乏自我控制。成人也可能有残余的症状，比如行为冲动和注意力困难。学习障碍如诵读困难、算术和感知困难、写作困难。

Behavioural problems may include compulsive and repetitive behaviours, attention problems, sleep difficulties, depression, poor self-esteem, poor school performance, social isolation, school and social phobia. Some commonly observed problems include oppositional/defiant behaviour, aggressive and uncooperative behaviours.

行为问题可能包括强迫性和重复性行为、注意力问题、失眠、抑郁、自卑、学校表现差、交际孤立、学校和社交恐惧症。一些常见的问题包括对立/挑衅行为，好斗和不合作的行为。
