## What causes the symptoms? 病因是什么?

The cause has not been definitely established, although current research presents considerable evidence that the disorder stems from the abnormal metabolism of at least one brain chemical (neurotransmitter) called dopamine. Undoubtedly other neurotransmitters are also involved.

病因目前尚未明确。目前的研究表明，这种紊乱至少是由一种称为多巴胺的脑化学物质（神经递质）的异常代谢引起的。其他神经递质无疑也有联系。

## Is there a cure? 可以治愈吗?

Not yet, but medication can be effective to control some of the symptoms in some cases. Education of the individual, family and friends on the disorder and learning management techniques can help reduce symptoms.

目前还不能。在某些情况下，药物可以有效地控制症状。对个人、家庭和朋友的教育、学习管理技术有助于减少症状。

## How is TS treated? 如何治疗?

Treatments for Tourette Syndrome may consist of pharmacological or non-pharmacological or a combination of both.

治疗可包括药理学或非药理方案，或二者结合。

There are several drugs, which can reduce the symptoms of TS for many people. Unless symptoms substantially interfere with a person’s life, medication may not be necessary. None of the medication currently available for treatment of TS will entirely eliminate all symptoms. Instead symptoms may be reduced, sometimes substantially, but they will continue to wax and wane, and they will commonly appear more pronounced during stressful periods.

有几种药物可以减少大部分TS患者的症状。除非症状严重干扰了一个人的生活，否则药物并不必要。目前治疗TS的药物都不能完全消除所有症状。相反，症状可能会减少或消除，但他们将继续起伏，并在紧张的时期再次显现。

A behavioural treatment with proven efficacy called CBIT has been gaining increasing interest:

一种被称为CIT的有效治疗行为得到了越来越多的关注： 

[CBIT — Comprehensive Behavioural Intervention for Tics](http://www.tourette.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/CBIT_TSA_Brochure.pdf
)

Other non-pharmacological treatments can be helpful. The below book is a starting point as many treatments already in use by psychologists and psychiatrists can be applied to assist with TS.

## Is it inherited? 会遗传吗?

Studies suggest that TS is inherited as a dominant gene that may produce different symptoms in different family members. A person with TS has about a 50% chance of passing it on to his/her children, however it may not appear as a recognisable disorder to that extent. The gene may express itself as TS, as a milder tic disorder or as obsessive-compulsive symptoms with no tics at all. It is now known that a higher than normal incidence of milder tic disorders and obsessive-compulsive behaviours occur in the families of TS patients. In some cases, TS may not be inherited, and is identified as sporadic TS because the cause is unknown.

研究表明，TS作为显性基因遗传，并在不同的家庭成员中产生不同的症状。一个患有TS的人大约有50%的机会将其传递给其子女，但可能不会成为一种可观察到的病症。该基因可以表达为TS，或作为轻度抽动障碍，或没有抽搐的强迫症。已经查明，在TS患者的家庭中更常见轻度的抽动障碍和强迫症行为。在某些情况下，TS可能不是遗传性的，并因为原因不明被划为零星发病。

## Can people with TS delay or suppress their symptoms? 患者能推延或者抑制症状吗?

Postponement or substitution of TS symptoms is a skill that some people are able to master. It requires considerable energy and concentration to inhibit vocalisations or motor movements for even a few minutes. Family members, teachers and co-workers must be understanding and compassionate when this cannot be accomplished. To avoid embarrassment and ridicule, in certain social situations some children and adults with TS often try to inhibit their symptoms. Symptoms may however emerge more explosively when they arrive home or are able to shelter themselves in private surroundings where they feel more comfortable. This phenomenon can create a diagnostic problem for physicians who often do not observe tic symptoms during examination.

延迟或替代TS症状是一些患者掌握的技能。即使是抑制发声或运动几分钟，亦需要相当大的意志力和注意力。家庭成员、教师和同事必须理解和富有同情心。为了避免尴尬和嘲笑，在某些社会情况下，一些患有TS的儿童和成人常常试图抑制他们的症状。但当他们到家或能够躲避在感到更舒服的私人环境中时，症状可能会更爆发出现。这种现象可能会产生一个诊断问题，即医生常常在诊断过程中观察不到抽动症状。

## Is TS a psychiatric disorder? TS是心里疾病吗?

No, TS is a neurological disorder. Secondary psychological problems (e.g., depression) may however arise from persistent difficulties in coping with the disorder and society’s reaction to its unique symptoms. Some behavioural difficulties that may be a part of the syndrome (i.e., poor attention span, compulsiveness, aggressive outbursts) can also cause significant adjustment problems. In some cases psychological counselling may be needed to help a person with TS adjust, come to terms with TS and build coping skills.

不，TS是神经系统疾病。然而，由于长期无法克服症状及社会对其独特症状的反应，继发性心理问题（例如抑郁症）可能产生。一些行为困难可能是该综合征的一部分（即注意力缺陷、强迫、攻击性爆发）也会导致明显的调节(?)问题。在某些情况下，可能需要心理咨询以帮助TS患者调整、接受TS和培养应对技能。

## How is TS diagnosed? TS是如何诊断的?

The diagnosis is made by observing the symptoms and by evaluating the history of their onset. No blood analysis, x-ray or other type of medical test exists to identify TS. A doctor may however order an EEG, CAT scan or certain blood tests to rule out other ailments that could be confused with TS.

诊断主要通过观察症状和评估发病史。不存在血液化验、X射线或其他类型的医学测试来识别TS。然而，医生可能会要求EEG、CAT扫描或某些血液测试来排除可能与TS混淆的其他疾病。

## Can people with TS lead normal lives? TS患者能够过正常的生活吗?

They certainly can, and the great majority do. People with TS do not become less intelligent. Many reach high achievement in the areas of academia, business and sportsmanship.

绝对可以，而且大多数人都能。患有TS的人不会变笨。很多人在学术界、商业界、体育界等领域都有高成就。

## Is there ever a remission? 会缓解吗?

Some people experience periods where the symptoms seem to disappear, others experience a marked improvement in their late teens or early twenties.

有些人会经历一段时期症状似乎消失了，其他人会在青春期末或二十岁初有明显缓解。

## How would a typical case of TS be described? 典型病例是怎样的?

The term typical cannot be applied to TS. The expression of symptoms covers a spectrum from very mild to very severe. TS is an individual and complex disorder.

对于TS来说没有“典型”的概念。症状有一系列谱系表现，从很轻到很重。TS是一种个体的复杂障碍。

## Do children with TS have special educational needs? 具有TS的孩子需要特殊教育吗?

Whilst children with TS as a group have the same IQ range as the population at large, many have special educational needs. It is estimated that many may have some kind of learning problem. That difficulty, combined with attention deficit and the problems inherent in dealing with the tics, may call for special educational assistance.

虽然TS群体的智力范围与常人无异，但很多人都需要特殊的教育。据估计，许多人可能有某种学习问题。这种困难加上注意缺陷和处理抽动引发的问题，可能需要特殊的教育援助。

## Is it important to treat TS early? 早治疗很重要吗?

Yes, particularly in instances when the symptomatology of the condition is viewed by some people as bizarre, disruptive and worrying. Not infrequently, it provokes ridicule and rejection by peers, neighbours, teachers and even casual observers. Parents may be overwhelmed by the strangeness of their child’s behaviour. The child may be threatened, excluded from family activities, and prevented from enjoying normal interpersonal relationships due to ignorance of the disorder. These difficulties may become greater during adolescence, an especially trying time for young people, and even more so for a person coping with a neurological problem. To avoid psychological harm, early diagnosis and treatment are crucial. The opportunity for parents and young people to gain mutual support can be very important. TS is not well known, but as more doctors become aware of the symptoms, undiagnosed cases are likely to decrease in the future. Early intervention certainly leads to better outcomes.

是的，尤其是在一些人认为这种疾病的症状是怪诞的、破坏性的和令人担忧的情况下。症状常常会引起同龄人、邻居、老师甚至是旁观者的嘲笑和拒绝。父母可能会因为孩子行为的奇怪而不知所措。儿童可能受到威胁，被排除在家庭活动之外，并且由于不了解疾病而阻止享受正常的人际关系。这些困难可能在青春期发酵，对年轻人来说尤为艰难，对于应对神经紊乱的人来说更是如此。为了避免心理伤害，早期诊断和治疗是至关重要的。父母和年轻人获得相互支持的机会非常重要。TS并不广为人知，但随着越来越多的医生意识到这些症状，未确诊的病例将来可能会减少。早期干预肯定会带来更好的结果。

## How many people have TS? 有多少人患有TS?

We don’t know for sure but recent research suggests as many as 1 in 200 people. The current prevalence rate in children is 1 in 100.

我们没有确凿的数据。但是最近的研究表明，每200个人中就有一个；目前在儿童中的流行率是百分之一。

## How did Tourette Syndrome get its name? 该病是如何得名的？

Dr George Gilles de la Tourette (1857 – 1904) was a neurologist living in France. He was the first to identify the syndrome by giving a description of the Marquise de la Dampierre, a noble woman whose symptoms included copralalia. She lived to the age of 86.

George Gilles de la Tourette博士是一名法国神经学家。他第一个从Marquise de la Dampierre女士识别出该综合征。该女士的症状包括秽语，她活到了86岁。


## What is the Tourette Syndrome Association of Australia (TSAA) and what does it do?

TSAA is a voluntary and non-profit organisation consisting of people with TS, their families, health and education professionals and other interested and concerned people. The association disseminates educational materials in the fields of health care, education and welfare service, provides telephone counselling and operates support groups. We support parent advocacy and other services to help families cope with problems that may occur with TS. The association regularly publishes a newsletter and organises workshops. The Association keeps a register of doctors who are experienced in diagnosing and treating TS. We continue to work towards better treatments and improving the overall quality of life for people with TS.
