## Talent over Tourettes

The resource consists of an activity kit for use by families, teachers and counsellors as a tool to encourage personal development. The kit includes 4 posters, a spin wheel and game. The aim of the game is to engage and encourage discovery of interests and hobbies via questions and answers leading to finding their ‘Talent over Tourettes’ to assist children with Tourette Syndrome to raise self-esteem and success through hyperfocus. When a person with TS is absorbed in a task requiring focus their tics often subside. This state of hyperfocus can provide relief from tics and help the child experience success.
